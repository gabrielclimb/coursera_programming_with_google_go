- Advantages of go
	 - code runs fast 
	 - garbage collector

- Compiled Language:
	- a compiled language is a language where the translation from high-level language to machine code happens **one time before you execute** the code, before you deploy the code, happens one time
	- So, the idea behind a compiled languages, the key thing we want to bring out anyway is the fact that this translation occurs once, it doesn't occur while you're running the code
- Interpreted Language:
	- So, the idea behind a compiled languages, the key thing we want to bring out anyway is the fact that this translation occurs once, it doesn't occur while you're running the code.

Go language is object-oriented, but let's say, weakly object-oriented.

- Concurrency
	- Parallellism
		- when do start and stop?
		- conflict memory
	- Concurrent
		- Concurrency is the management of multiple tasks at the same time.
		- Concurrent programming enables parallelism
			- communication between tasks
			- sync between tasks
			- management of tasks execution
	- In Go
		- Goroutines
		- Channels
